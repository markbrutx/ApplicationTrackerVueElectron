## Why This Project Exists

Job searching can feel like throwing applications into a void - you send them out day after day, often without any immediate response. This can be mentally draining and demotivating. I created this application to make this process more bearable and even engaging.

The app turns each application into a small victory with satisfying sound effects and streak tracking, while the built-in template generator helps quickly create customized cover letters and comments for job posts. Plus, with Firebase integration, your progress syncs across devices, so you never lose track of your efforts.
